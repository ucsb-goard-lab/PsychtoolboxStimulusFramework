classdef MicroscopeTriggerer < FrameworkObject
	%{
    Controls the DAQ and allows microscope triggering. If the microscope is the 2P, it doesn't need the length of the stimulus because the 2P only sends specific triggers. On the other hand, the widefield needs the length because it triggers each frame.
